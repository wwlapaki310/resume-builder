Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Senior Software Engineer position for Generative AI on the Google Cloud AI team. With over **7 years of ML/AI experience** and a proven track record as a Forward-Deployed Engineer at Sony Semiconductor Solutions, I am excited about the opportunity to help customers unlock the transformative potential of Google's Generative AI platform.

**Why I'm Uniquely Qualified**

My experience architecting customer-facing AI solutions directly aligns with this role's core mission. At Sony, I have spent the past 6 years in a Forward-Deployed Engineer capacity, working hands-on with enterprise customers to:

- **Architect end-to-end AI systems:** I led requirements gathering at customer sites (logistics warehouses, manufacturing facilities), designed edge-cloud hybrid solutions, and deployed production systems integrating IMX500 AI cameras with Azure and AWS cloud platforms.

- **Enable customer success through technical leadership:** I conducted on-site technical workshops, provided hands-on training to partner companies, and served as the technical bridge between customer needs and platform capabilities.

- **Drive international collaboration:** I successfully partnered with the Raspberry Pi Foundation and Sweden-based Lund AB, conducting technical discussions in English, managing OSS publication requirements, and delivering collaborative sample applications to the global developer community.

**Technical Depth Meets Customer Focus**

My technical foundation is built on **7+ years of ML/AI expertise**, beginning with founding a machine learning community in 2018 and extending through production deployments of Computer Vision systems. I hold certifications across all three major cloud platforms (Google Cloud Architect, AWS Solutions Architect, Azure AI), demonstrating both breadth and commitment to continuous learning. My full-stack development experience (Python, Next.js, FastAPI) enables me to build complete solutions, not just theoretical architectures.

**From Edge AI to Generative AI**

While my primary expertise is in Edge AI and Computer Vision, I am deeply passionate about Generative AI's potential to revolutionize how businesses operate. My experience optimizing AI models for resource-constrained edge devices has given me a nuanced understanding of performance optimization, latency requirements, and real-world deployment challenges—skills that translate directly to building production Generative AI applications. I am actively expanding my expertise in LLMs and RAG architectures, and I'm eager to apply my proven ability to rapidly master new technologies to Google's Generative AI stack.

**Why Google Cloud AI**

Google's leadership in Generative AI, from Gemini to Vertex AI, represents the future of enterprise AI adoption. I am particularly drawn to this role because it combines my two passions: solving real customer problems and working with cutting-edge AI technology. The opportunity to help customers across Japan and APAC unlock value from Generative AI—bridging technical innovation with business impact—is exactly where I want to direct my career.

My bilingual capabilities (TOEIC 800, proven international collaboration experience) position me to serve both Japanese domestic customers and global teams effectively. My experience working with diverse stakeholders, from warehouse operations staff to C-level executives, has taught me how to communicate complex technical concepts at the appropriate level for each audience.

**What I Bring to Your Team**

- **Immediate customer impact:** 6 years of Forward-Deployed Engineer experience means I can start delivering customer value from day one
- **Technical credibility:** 7+ years of ML/AI production experience builds trust with technical decision-makers
- **Proven international collaboration:** Successfully managed technical partnerships with European companies
- **Solutions mindset:** I don't just understand technology; I architect solutions that solve real business problems
- **Growth trajectory:** Track record of rapidly learning new technologies (evidenced by multiple certifications and award-winning projects)

I am excited about the possibility of bringing my customer-facing technical architecture experience to Google Cloud AI, where I can help customers harness the power of Generative AI to transform their businesses. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience aligns with your team's goals.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of contributing to Google Cloud's Generative AI mission.

Sincerely,

**Satoru Akita**
